# Crafting Tower Defense Game

![Game Banner](assets/Crafted_Guardians.png)

Welcome to the **Crafting Tower Defense Game**, a GameMaker Studio 2 project built to showcase a mix of crafting, resource management, and tower defense gameplay. This game features six unique levels, a Firebase-integrated leaderboard, and a variety of enemies and items to keep the player engaged. It was developed to deepen my understanding of GameMaker Language (GML) and to explore game development workflows.
